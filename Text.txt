1. What is React and why is it used?
   - React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is used to create reusable UI components that update efficiently in response to data changes.

2. Explain the concept of Virtual DOM in React.
   - The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM in memory. React uses it to improve performance by updating only the changed parts of the DOM instead of re-rendering the entire DOM.

3. What is JSX in React?
   - JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript recommended by React. It allows you to write HTML elements and components in a syntax that looks similar to XML or HTML.

4. What is the significance of state in React?
   - State is a JavaScript object that holds component-specific data. When the state of a component changes, React automatically re-renders the component, updating the UI to reflect the new state.

5. What is the difference between props and state?
   - Props are immutable and are used to pass data from parent to child components. State is mutable and is used to manage a component's internal data.

6. What is the purpose of the useEffect hook in React?
   - The `useEffect` hook is used to perform side effects in functional components. It is often used for tasks like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.

7. Explain the concept of controlled and uncontrolled components in React forms.
   - Controlled components are those whose form elements are controlled by React state. Uncontrolled components rely on the DOM to handle form data.

8. What is Redux, and why might you use it in a React application?
   - Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications. It is often used with React to manage the state of the entire application in a predictable way.

9. What is the significance of React Router?
   - React Router is a library for handling navigation in React applications. It enables the creation of single-page applications with dynamic, client-side routing.

10. Explain the purpose of keys in React lists.
    - Keys are used to give a stable identity to elements during rendering. They help React identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed.

11. What are React hooks, and why were they introduced?
    - React hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. They were introduced to allow the use of state and lifecycle features in functional components.

12. Differentiate between class components and functional components in React.
    - Class components use ES6 classes and have additional features like lifecycle methods. Functional components are simpler and are often used with hooks for state management.

13. How does React handle conditional rendering?
    - React uses conditional rendering to display different components or elements based on certain conditions. This is often done using the ternary operator or logical operators.

14. What is the significance of the `key` prop in React?
    - The `key` prop is used to uniquely identify elements in an array. It helps React efficiently update the DOM by recognizing which items have changed, been added, or been removed.

15. What is the purpose of the `useState` hook in React?
    - The `useState` hook is used to add state to functional components. It returns an array with the current state value and a function that lets you update the state.

16. Explain the concept of lifting state up in React.
    - Lifting state up is a pattern where the state is moved to a higher-level component, allowing it to be shared by multiple child components. This is often used to synchronize state between components.

17. What is the role of the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` attribute in React?
    - `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to insert raw HTML content into a component. It is called "dangerous" because it can expose the application to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if not used carefully.

18. What is the purpose of the `memo` function in React?
    - The `memo` function is used to memoize functional components, preventing unnecessary renders if the component's props have not changed.

19. What is the significance of the `context` API in React?
    - The `context` API allows you to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level. It simplifies state management in larger applications.

20. Explain the concept of lazy loading in React.
    - Lazy loading is a technique used to defer the loading of certain parts of a React application until they are actually needed. This can improve the initial loading time of the application.
